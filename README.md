# Snake Game on the Browser with p5.js Library
I wanted to start with web development. So I found this library called p5.js, which is very easy for begginers to use. So, as my first project, I saw an interesting coding challenge by Daniel Shiffman on which he makes a snake game with the p5.js library. So, wanting to make my own game and improving it, I started to code. You can find his coding challenge <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM&t=1383s">here</a>.
My main goal with this project is make it a multiplayer, almost as <a href="http://slither.io/">slither.io</a>, but with the style of the original Snake Game, pixelated.

Currently the game has no score system or end, you just sit with somebody and colect the food. I plan to do a score system, along with a mechanism of eating the other person. Since this is a game projected to be played by persons in the same browser, it has a limit of two players. I plan in the future, with more advanced libraries and stuff, to make the game support many players, each one on its own computer.
Those are the plans. Hope you like it and enjoy it on your own!
